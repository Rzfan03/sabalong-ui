# What is SabalongUI?

**SabalongUI** is a comprehensive UI Library built with **React** and **TailwindCSS**. It is designed to provide developers with highly flexible components that can be customized down to the core logic and styling.

### Why SabalongUI?

The primary motivation behind SabalongUI is the need for a UI library that offers total customization without the constraints often found in more rigid frameworks. While many libraries provide pre-styled components, SabalongUI focuses on being **"fully customizable to the roots,"** allowing you to adapt every detail to fit your specific design requirements.

This project also serves as a professional portfolio piece to demonstrate advanced component architecture and integration between React and TailwindCSS.

### Inspiration

This project is inspired by [Selia UI](https://selia.nauv.al/), a minimalist and efficient UI library. You can explore the inspiration behind these patterns at the official site.
